### Here’s a list of the things you need to learn to get prepared for OSCP:

- Linux and Windows Environment: You need to be familiar with both. 
These will help you spot clues for privilege escalation. I’m a Windows guy and during the labs, I learned Linux the hard way.
  
- Linux and Windows Commands: Knowing Linux and Windows commands helps a lot. Brush up on them!
- Basic Programming Skills: Expect to debug and rewrite exploits, so know Bash Scripting. This will help you to automate redundant tasks.
- Web application attacks (SQLi, XSS, Local File Inclusion, Remote File Inclusion, and Command Execution): Expect a lot of web application content in the labs. Also, practice bypassing web security filters for injection attacks.
- Metasploit Framework: Brush up on creating payloads with different formats, using multi handlers, and using staged vs non-staged payloads. Knowing these things will save you some time during your exam.
- Nmap: Different scanning techniques and Nmap NSE Scripts will help you a lot during your lab or exam.
- Netcat and Ncat: You’ll be using these a lot during the OSCP.
- Wireshark and tcpdump: Those are important because you’ll be using Wireshark to debug your exploit - or tcpdump, when machines don’t have a GUI.
- Windows and Linux Privilege Escalation: Aside from using kernel exploits, brush up on misconfigurations like weak service/file permissions and NFS/Shares.
- Escaping restricted shells and spawning shells: You’ll encounter these a lot during your OSCP.
- File transfer: It is important that you know the different techniques to transfer files to a target machine.

### Aside from those topics, these books will also come in handy:

- Kali Linux Revealed - To freshen up your Linux Fundamentals.
- Penetration Testing: A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking - One of my favorite books. This book covers almost all the aspects of what the OSCP entails.
- Web Application Hackers Handbook - I highly suggest reading this book, especially if you’re new to web application penetration testing. The book covers web application attacks from attacking access controls, application logic, and application servers.
- Rtfm: Red Team Field Manual - This is a great cheat sheet for pen testers.
- Hacking: The Art of Exploitation 2nd Edition - This book covers deeper knowledge about penetration testing.
